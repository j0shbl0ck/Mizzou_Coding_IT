            Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG, Insta or the gram)[9] is an American photo and video sharing social networking service created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[10]
            Instagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) aspect ratio with 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, these restrictions were eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a 'stories' feature—similar to its main opposition Snapchat—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature is used by 500 million users daily.[10]
            Originally launched for iOS in October 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion as of June 2018.[11] The Android version was released in April 2012, followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016. As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although praised for its influence, Instagram has been the subject of criticism, most notably for policy and interface changes, allegations of censorship, and illegal or improper content uploaded by users.
            As of June 2021, the most followed person is Portuguese professional footballer Cristiano Ronaldo with over 300 million followers.[12] The most followed woman is American singer Ariana Grande. As of January 14, 2019, the most-liked photo on Instagram is a picture of an egg, posted by the account @world_record_egg, created with the sole purpose of surpassing the previous record of 18 million likes on a Kylie Jenner post. The picture currently has over 55 million likes.[13] The second most-liked photo is a wedding photo of Ariana Grande and her husband Dalton Gomez.[14] Instagram became the 4th most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[12]
            Users can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds,[106] and geotag images with the name of a location.[107] Users can set their account as "private", thereby requiring that they approve any new follower requests.[108] Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites, enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites.[109] In September 2011, a new version of the app included new and live filters, instant tilt–shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click rotation, and an updated icon.[110][111] Photos were initially restricted to a square, 1:1 aspect ratio; since August 2015, the app supports portrait and widescreen aspect ratios as well.[112][113][114] Users could formerly view a map of a user's geotagged photos. The feature was removed in September 2016, citing low usage.[115][116]
            Since December 2016, posts can be "saved" into a private area of the app.[117][118] The feature was updated in April 2017 to let users organize saved posts into named collections.[119][120] Users can also "archive" their posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of "likes" or are deemed boring, but also as a way to limit the "emergent behavior" of deleting photos, which deprives the service of content.[121][122] In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads, letting users more easily interact with replies.[123][124]
            Since February 2017, up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel.[125][126] The feature originally limited photos to the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead.[127][128]
            In April 2018, Instagram launched its version of a portrait mode called "focus mode," which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while keeping the subject in focus when selected.[129] In November, Instagram began to support Alt text to add descriptions of photos for the visually impaired. They are either generated automatically using object recognition (using existing Facebook technology) or manually specified by the uploader.[130]
            On March 1, 2021, Instagram launched a new feature named Instagram Live "Rooms" Let Four People Go Live Together.[131]
            In May 2021, Instagram announced a new accessibility feature for videos on Instagram Reels and Stories to allow creators to place closed captions on their content.[132]

            Hashtags
            In January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags to help users discover both photos and each other.[133][134] Instagram encourages users to make tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like "photo", to make photographs stand out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.[135]
            Users on Instagram have created "trends" through hashtags. The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on. Examples of popular trends include #SelfieSunday, in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays; #MotivationMonday, in which users post motivational photos on Mondays; #TransformationTuesday, in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present; #WomanCrushWednesday, in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably, as well as its #ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men; and #ThrowbackThursday, in which users post a photo from their past, highlighting a particular moment.[136][137]
            In December 2017, Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags, which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds.[138][139]

            Explore
            In June 2012, Instagram introduced "Explore", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos taken at nearby locations, and search.[140] The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations.[141] In April 2016, Instagram added a "Videos You Might Like" channel to the tab,[142][143] followed by an "Events" channel in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports games, and other live events,[144][145] followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in October.[146][147] The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an algorithmically-curated page of the "best" Instagram Live videos currently airing.[148] In May 2017, Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places.[149]
            
            Photographic filters
            Instagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images. In February 2012, Instagram added a "Lux" filter, an effect that "lightens shadows, darkens highlights and increases contrast".[150][151] In December 2014, Slumber, Crema, Ludwig, Aden, and Perpetua were five new filters to be added to the Instagram filter family.[152]
            
            Video
            Initially a purely photo-sharing service, Instagram incorporated 15-second video sharing in June 2013.[153][154] The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook's attempt at competing with the then-popular video-sharing application Vine.[155][156] In August 2015, Instagram added support for widescreen videos.[157][158] In March 2016, Instagram increased the 15-second video limit to 60 seconds.[159][160] Albums were introduced in February 2017, which allow up to 10 minutes of video to be shared in one post.[125][126][161]
        
            IGTV
            IGTV is a vertical video application launched by Instagram[162] in June 2018. Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website. IGTV allows uploads of up to 10 minutes in length with a file size of up to 650 MB, with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to 60 minutes in length with a file size of up to 5.4 GB.[163] The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched, which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video.[164][165][166]
            
            Reels
            In November 2019, it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as "Reels" in Brazil, expanding to France and Germany afterwards.[167] It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video-sharing service TikTok, with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre-existing sound clips from other posts.[168] Users could make up to 15 (later 30) second videos using this feature.[169] Reels also integrates with existing Instagram filters and editing tools.[163]
            In July 2020, Instagram rolled out Reels to India after TikTok was banned in the country.[170] The following month, Reels officially launched in 50 countries including the United States, Canada and United Kingdom.[171] Instagram has recently introduced a reel button on home page.[172]
            On June 17, 2021, Instagram launched full-screen advertisements in Reels. The ads are similar to regular reels and can run up to 30 seconds. They are distinguished from regular content by the "sponsored" tag under the account name.[173]

            Instagram Direct
            In December 2013, Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a feature that lets users interact through private messaging. Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos, in contrast to the public-only requirement that was previously in place. When users receive a private message from someone they don't follow, the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it. Users can send a photo to a maximum of 15 people.[174][175][176] The feature received a major update in September 2015, adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations, hashtag pages, and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed. Additionally, users can now reply to private messages with text, emoji or by clicking on a heart icon. A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation.[177][178][179] A new update in November 2016 let users make their private messages "disappear" after being viewed by the recipient, with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot.[180][181]
            In April 2017, Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages, both permanent and ephemeral, into the same message threads.[182][183][184] In May, Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages, and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping.[185][186]
            In April 2020, Direct became accessible from the Instagram website, allowing users to send direct messages from a web version using WebSocket technology.[187]
            In August 2020, Facebook started merging Instagram Direct into Facebook Messenger. After the update (which is rolled out to a segment of the user base) the Instagram Direct icon transforms into Facebook Messenger icon.[188]
            In March 2021, a feature was added that prevents adults from messaging users under 18 who do not follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies.[100][101][102]

            Instagram Stories
            In August 2016, Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a feature that allows users to take photos, add effects and layers, and add them to their Instagram story. Images uploaded to a user's story expire after 24 hours. The media noted the feature's similarities to Snapchat.[189][190] In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat, CEO Kevin Systrom told Recode that "Day One: Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic, Twitter [and] some stuff from Facebook like the 'Like' button. You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app, somewhere in the history of technology". Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as "fair", Recode wrote that "he likened the two social apps' common features to the auto industry: Multiple car companies can coexist, with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences". Systrom further stated that "When we adopted [Stories], we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn't pause it to look at something, you couldn't rewind. We did all that, we implemented that." He also told the publication that Snapchat "didn't have filters, originally. They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well."[191][192]
            In November, Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories, allowing users to broadcast themselves live, with the video disappearing immediately after ending.[193][148]
            In January 2017, Instagram launched skippable ads, where five-second photo and 15-second video ads appear in-between different stories.[194][195][196]
            In April 2017, Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers, a "clone" of Snapchat's functionality.[197][198][196]
            In May 2017, Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters, letting users add specific visual features onto their faces.[199][200]
            Later in May, TechCrunch reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories, where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business, landmark or place's Instagram page.[201] A few days later, Instagram announced "Story Search", in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term.[149][202]
            In June 2017, Instagram revised its live-video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next 24 hours, or discard the broadcast immediately.[203] In July, Instagram started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos, complete with Instagram effects such as filters, stickers, and hashtags.[204][205]
            Stories were made available for viewing on Instagram's mobile and desktop websites in late August 2017.[206][207]
            On December 5, 2017, Instagram introduced "Story Highlights",[208] also known as "Permanent Stories", which are similar to Instagram Stories, but don't expire. They appear as circles below the profile picture and biography and are accessible from the desktop website as well.
            In June 2018, the daily active story users of Instagram had reached 400 million users, and monthly active users had reached 1 billion active users.[209]

            Advertising
            Emily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April 2013.[210][211] She stated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September 2013 that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September 2014 as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company.[212] White left Instagram in December 2013 to join Snapchat.[213][214] In August 2014, James Quarles became Instagram's Global Head of Business and Brand Development, tasked with overseeing advertisement, sales efforts, and developing new "monetization products", according to a spokesperson.[215]
            In October 2013, Instagram announced that video and image ads would soon appear in feeds for users in the United States,[216][217] with the first image advertisements displaying on November 1, 2013.[218][219] Video ads followed nearly a year later on October 30, 2014.[220][221] In June 2014, Instagram announced the rollout of ads in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia,[222] with ads starting to roll out that autumn.[223]
            In March 2015, Instagram announced it would implement "carousel ads," allowing advertisers to display multiple images with options for linking to additional content.[224][225] The company launched carousel image ads in October 2015,[226][227] and video carousel ads in March 2016.[228]
            In May 2016, Instagram launched new tools for business accounts, including business profiles, analytics and the ability to promote posts as ads. To access the tools, businesses had to link a corresponding Facebook page.[229] The new analytics page, known as Instagram Insights, allowed business accounts to view top posts, reach, impressions, engagement and demographic data.[229] Insights rolled out first in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, and expanded to the rest of the world later in 2016.[230][229][231]
            In February 2016, Instagram announced that it had 200,000 advertisers on the platform.[232] This number increased to 500,000 by September 2016,[233] and 1 million in March 2017.[234][235]
            In November 2018, Instagram added the ability for business accounts to add product links directing users to a purchase page or to save them to a "shopping list."[236] In April 2019, Instagram added the option to "Checkout on Instagram," which allows merchants to sell products directly through the Instagram app.[237]
            In March 2020, via a blog post, Instagram announced that they are making major moderation changes in order to decrease the flow of disinformation, hoaxes and fake news regarding COVID-19 on its platform, "We'll remove COVID-19 accounts from account recommendations, and we are working to remove some COVID-19 related content from Explore unless posted by a credible health organization. We will also start to downrank content in feed and Stories that has been rated false by third-party fact-checkers."[238]

            Stand-alone apps
            Instagram has developed and released three stand-alone apps with specialized functionality. In July 2014, it released Bolt, a messaging app where users click on a friend's profile photo to quickly send an image, with the content disappearing after being seen.[239][240] It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August, an iOS-exclusive app that uses "clever algorithm processing" to create tracking shots and fast time-lapse videos.[241][242] Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May 2015, but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date.[243] In October 2015, it released Boomerang, a video app that combines photos into short, one-second videos that play back-and-forth in a loop.[244][245]
