# Mizzou_Coding_IT

This repository contains all code from assignments, projects, and finals. Code is, "**AS IS**" and does not hold liability to your device or grade. It would be wise to use reverse engineering. What is reverse engineering? It's used for breaking something down in order to understand it, build a copy or improve it.
