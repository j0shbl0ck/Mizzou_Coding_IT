# Mizzou_Coding_IT

This repository contains all code from assignments, projects, and finals. Code is, "**AS IS**" and does not hold liability to your device or grade. It would be wise to use reverse engineering. Reverse-engineering is the act of dismantling an object to see how it works. It is done primarily to analyze and gain knowledge about the way something works.
